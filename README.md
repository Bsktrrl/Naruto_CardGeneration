## Project Description
Since 2017 I have been working on a tabletop game set to the Naruto universe. 
Most of my time have been used making cards in Photoshop, but this process can be tedious when text and icons have to be matched for each card and the project file becomes large. 
After getting some coding knowledge, I could build my own card generator suitable for the card types in my game. 
I have expanded upon this throughout the development process and will never go back to the way I did things revious.
