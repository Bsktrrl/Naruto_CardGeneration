## Project Description
Since 2017 I have been working on a tabletop game set to the Naruto universe. 
Most of my time have been used making cards in Photoshop, but this process can be tedious when text and icons have to be matched for each card and when the project file becomes large.
<br>
<br>
So, I built my own card generator, suitable for the card types in my game.
This new way of developing cards have marked a shift in my productivity, so I will continue making new card generators for future game projects.
<br>
<br>
The game feature 4 different types of cards, and therefore needs 4 different setups to keep track of the changes.
I use ScriptableObjects as information input, making the parameters make changes to the card.
<br>
<br>
As of now, the program only works in the "Unity Engine Editor". I may build a generic program in the future.
